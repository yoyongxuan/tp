### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of CadetHQ.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of CadetHQ.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the CadetHQ in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the `AddressBook` data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both `AddressBook` data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

Persistent data is stored as local JSON files, located in the same folder where the JAR file for CadetHQ is ran. The following JSON files are created:

- `preferences.json`
- `config.json`
- `data/cadethq.json`

[Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is used for JSON (de)serialization and relies on adapted models via the [Data Transfer Object pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/java-dto-pattern).

#### Malformed JSONs

If a JSON file is malformed, the contents will not be loaded and a log message will be printed. A malformed JSON file includes files that have invalid JSON syntax or files that are missing crucial user data.

No proactive measures are taken to rectify the issue, such as deleting the file or fixing the error. This decision was made to avoid prescribing a fixed approach to resolving malformed JSON files. Instead, we simply load sensible defaults, such as placeholder data when the user loads the application, and overwrite the malformed JSON file when the user inputs data.

For `data/cadethq.json`, this occurs when adding, editing or deleting the student contact list.

For `preferences.json`, this occurs in the `MainApp#initPrefs` method.

For `config.json`, this occurs in the `MainApp#initConfig` method.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort Command
**Overview**

Sort command sorts the list of students according to the argument `n/` or `ex/`.

Below is the sequence diagram that describes how sorting is done. The example below uses `sort ex/midterm` as an example:

**Logic Component**

![SortSequenceLogicDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The reference frame name should be at the top left corner, but due to a limitation with PlantUML, it is at the bottom middle.
</div>


**Model Component**

![SortSequenceModelDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

**Details**:

Sorting is implemented through 3 comparators (`Comparator<Person>`) in the `Person` class as below:
* `NAME_COMPARATOR`: Used to sort in ascending alphabetical order.
* `MIDTERM_COMPARATOR`: Used to sort in ascending midterm score order. Students with no recorded midterm scores will be flushed to the end of the list.
* `FINAL_COMPARATOR`: Same as MIDTERM_COMPARATOR, but compares final score instead.

`Model` also contains a method to sort by exam (`sortPersonsByExam(EXAM)`) and by name (`sortPersonsByName()`).

`AddressBook` has 3 sorting methods that utilise the 3 `Comparator<Person>` above for sorting:
* `sortPersonsbyName()`
* `sortPersonsByMidterm()`
* `sortPersonsByFinal()`

### Edit the maximum score of an exam
**Overview**

The `maxscore` command allows the user to edit the maximum score of an exam in the `AddressBook`.

The sequence diagrams below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components, taking `execute("maxscore ex/final ms/105")` API call as an example.

**Logic Component**

![EditScoreCommand Sequence Diagram Logic Component](images/EditScoreCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditScoreCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The reference frame name should be at the top left corner, but due to a limitation with PlantUML, it is at the bottom middle.
</div>


**Details**:
1. The `LogicManager` object will be called to execute the input.
2. The `AddressBookParser` object will identify the command as `EditScoreCommand`, and create an `EditScoreCommandParser`.
3. The `EditScoreCommandParser` will parse `ex/final ms/105` and create an `EditCommand` which is returned to the `LogicManager`.
4. The `LogicManager` calls `execute` on the `EditScoreCommand` object, which interacts with the Model component. (drawn as a single step for simplicity)
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

**Model Component**

![EditScoreCommand Sequence Diagram Model Component](images/EditScoreCommandSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

**Details**:
1. The `execute` method in `EditScoreCommand` runs.
2. The `EditScoreCommand` object calls `isValidExam` and `isNewMaxScoreValid` to verify that `final` exists, and that the new max score meets all constraints.
- (Not shown in diagram) The `isNewMaxScoreValid` method compares the new max score `105` against all the recorded scores for all students, for the exam `final`. The new max score must be greater than or equal to all recorded scores for it to be valid.
3. The `EditScoreCommand` object calls `setMaxScore` on `Exam` to change the max score.
4. The `EditScoreCommand` object calls `getFilteredPersonList` on `Model` to retrieve all displayed people.
5. (Simplified in diagram) For each `Person` in the person list, a clone is created with the same information. The method `setPerson` of `Model` replaces each `Person` with the cloned `Person`, ensuring that the updated max score is reflected in the UI.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current `AddressBook` state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous `AddressBook` state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone `AddressBook` state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial `AddressBook` state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single `AddressBook` state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the `AddressBook`. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the `AddressBook` after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted `AddressBook` state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified `AddressBook` state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the `AddressBook` state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous `AddressBook` state, and restores the `AdressBook` to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the `AddressBook` to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest `AddressBook` state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the `AddressBook`, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all `AddressBook`
states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire `AddressBook`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to work with different screen resolutions as long as it meets the minimum window size of 450 x 600px.
3.  Should be able to start up within **5 seconds** on modern computer hardware (within the last 10 years).
4.  Should be able to hold up to **200 people** without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
5.  Command execution should not take more than **5 seconds**. For example, editing or adding a person should not take more than 5 seconds for the changes to be reflected in CadetHQ.
6.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
7.  Should work without installation.
8.  Should be usable by a CS1101S TA that has never used similar contact management applications before.
9.  Should be for a single user only (i.e. not a multi-user product, no shared file storage mechanism, no application running in a shared computer).
10. Invalid commands should not crash CadetHQ, but show an error message instead.
11. A user should be able to access command help information at any time.
12. The source code should be open source.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
* **CLI**: Command-Line Interface - A text-based interface for interacting with CadetHQ by typing commands.
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface - A visual interface that uses windows, buttons and menus, which is not the primary interface of the app.
* **NUS**: National University of Singapore.
* **CS1101S**: Programming Methodology module for NUS Computer Science students.
* **TA**: Teaching Assistant - The target users of CadetHQ.
* **Student ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each student in NUS.
* **Index**: The position of the student in the displayed list, starting from 1.
* **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation - A data format used to store and transfer information. CadetHQ stores data in JSON files.
* **JAR**: Java Archive - The packaged form of the application that can be distributed and executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. **Add/edit/delete exams**: CadetHQ currently only supports the recording of 2 static exams (midterm and final). Adding the ability to add more assessments manually such as <u>reading assessments</u> and <u>practical exams</u> allows TAs to monitor their students progress better throughout the semester. Being able to edit and delete exams allows TAs to have more flexibility in exam tracking if the curriculum changes in the future.

2. **Improve GUI for displaying of exam scores**: The current GUI displays the midterm and exam scores under each student. As more assessments are added, this may clutter the screen. A **dropdown menu** can be added to only show the exam scores when clicked.

3. **Mass attendance marking**: CadetHQ currently only allows the user to mark each student's attendance one at a time. Adding the ability to mass record attendance makes it easier to mark all students in a tutorial. Some proposed implementations are shown below:
    * `massattend 1-10 1`: marks attendance for students from index 1 to 10 in the list for tutorial 1.
    * `massattend t/TAG 5`: marks attendance for students with the specified `TAG` for tutorial 5.

4. **Enhanced find functionality**: CadetHQ currently only allows the user to search by name. Adding the ability to search by tutorial attended or tags, and allowing partial matches makes it easier for the user to find the students they are looking for.

5. **Improve GUI for displaying attendance**: The current GUI only displays tutorials that students have attended. Instead, it could show all the tutorials, and colour them red and green based on whether students have attended or not.

6. **More sorting**: Currently, CadetHQ only supports sorting in ascending order of names and exams. Add more sorting options like sorting in descending order or by attendance allows TAs to have more flexibility in list management.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
