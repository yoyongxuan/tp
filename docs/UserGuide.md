title: CadetHQ User Guide
---

CadetHQ is a **desktop app for managing student contacts, for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (TAs) at National University of Singapore (NUS)**.

It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

For CS1101S TAs that are good at using the Command Line, CadetHQ gives you the power to manage your students' grades, attendance, and contact information quickly, bypassing pesky menus that take ages to load and navigate.

#### Main features:
 - [Managing Students](#managing-students) - Add, edit or delete student records.
 - [Viewing Students](#viewing-students) - View, search or sort student information.
 - [Tracking Attendance](#tracking-attendance) - Record students' attendance.
 - [Handling Scores](#handling-scores) - Manage students' scores and modify exam scoring details.

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* All formats accept multiple spaces in between parameters. e.g. `score ‎ ‎  1 ‎ ‎ ‎   ex/  ‎ ‎  midterm  s/50` will be interpreted as `score 1 ex/midterm s/50`

* `SID` refers to the Student ID.

Format: `sort n/` or `sort ex/EXAM`

* `sort n/` sorts the students in ascending order by name.
* `sort ex/` sorts the students in ascending order by exam score for the specified exam.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Students with no recorded scores will be shifted to the bottom of the displayed student list when sorted by exam scores.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**

* To guard against accidental inputs/typos, `sort` <u>ignores</u> certain parts of the command that are <u>not needed in execution</u>.

* For `sort n/`, you can also input (though discouraged) `sort [preamble] n/[argument]`. Any extraneous inputs **that are not prefixes and/or command parameters used in sort** in the `[preamble]` and `[argument]` sections will be ignored.

## Miscellaneous

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from the Address Book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

### Saving the data

CadetHQ data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

CadetHQ data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/cadethq.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, cadethq.json will discard all data and start with a placeholder data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the cadethq.json to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous cadethq.json home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **When a person's details are very long**, e.g. their name, telegram handle, and **CadetHQ is set to a small window width size**, some details may be truncated `(...)` as the text does not wrap around. The remedy is to expand the window width to see the full details.
4. **Names that contain `/`, `,`, `-`, `@`, or other special characters cannot be added** in CadetHQ. An error message will be shown instead. CadetHQ currently does not support the use of special characters in names as some of these characters such as `/` are used internally in commands.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
    A remedy is to save the name without the special characters. For example, `Sumail S/O Subramaniam` can be saved as `Sumail SO Subramaniam` instead.`Tan Ah Meng, John` can be saved as `Tan Ah Meng John` instead. `Al-Amaan` can be saved as `AlAmaan` instead. `Tan Kah Ming @ Cheng Jia Ming` can be saved simply as `Tan Kah Ming`, or however the user decides to.
